# Vendetta-League-Bot
Old bot I used to manage all the players in Vendetta League, a surviv.io tournament discord server. Probably no longer working because of image links, the new OAUTH2 system, etc. Also looking back I added a ton of prank and trolling functions so that was cool

I was actively using this from 2019 - 2021, it was my first real discord bot. Also I made a website for Vendetta League, see what was going on in the server in 2021 before it was raided: https://sites.google.com/view/survivvendetta/home/staff-team?authuser=0

Do a ctrl+f and look for any "c.id" because those are for whatever the function is doing, like the rules channel, war rules channel, etc. Also "ID" I believe is supposed to be another channelID but don't remember exactly what it was.

Hosted on ReplIT and some free hosting service. 

Be sure to put the token into a secret or make the file private when running this, somebody took control of my bot that way because I was careless and that's how it all ended.
